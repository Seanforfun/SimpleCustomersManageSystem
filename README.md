# SimpleCustomersManageSystem
This is just a simple project used to practice some Mysql database operations.
This is my first project on github so probably not good enough but still a good start for myself.

Requirements:
Mysql Database.

Operations:
1.Enter file c3p0-config.xml to enter the properties of your current Mysql properties.
2.Enter the jsp file "success.jsp" to start all operations.

Functions:
1.Add new customer to database.
2.Deleted selected customers from database.
3.Modify the information of any customer.
4.Search the information according to some specific parameters.

Conclusion:
Thousands of bugs can be found from the small system. Please feel free to report the bugs.
But it is very possible that no one will read my first test.
